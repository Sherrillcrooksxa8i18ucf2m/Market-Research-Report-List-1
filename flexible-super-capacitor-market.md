<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Super Capacitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrochemical Double Layer Supercapacitor</li><li>Pseudocapacitor Supercapacitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flexible supercapacitor market consists of two main types: electrochemical double layer supercapacitors and pseudocapacitor supercapacitors. Electrochemical double layer supercapacitors store energy through the accumulation of ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, providing high power density and long cycle life. Pseudocapacitors, on the other hand, store energy through fast reversible redox reactions, offering higher energy density but with lower cycling stability. Both types play a crucial role in the development of flexible energy storage solutions for various applications.</p></p>
