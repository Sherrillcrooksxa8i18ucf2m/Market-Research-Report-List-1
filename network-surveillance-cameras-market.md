<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Network Surveillance Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Cameras</li><li>Decentralized IP Cameras</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centralized IP cameras are connected to a network video recorder (NVR) through a central server, which controls and manages all the cameras. This type of system is ideal for larger installations where multiple cameras need to be monitored from a central location.</p><p>Decentralized IP cameras, on the other hand, do not require a central server as they have built-in recording capabilities and can function independently. Each camera is able to record and store footage locally, making them a more cost-effective solution for smaller installations or locations with limited network infrastructure.</p></p>
