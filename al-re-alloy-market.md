<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Al-RE Alloy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Eutectic</li><li>Hypereutectic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Al-RE alloy market can be classified into Single Eutectic and Hypereutectic types based on the composition of rare earth elements (RE). In Single Eutectic alloys, the RE content is at a level where only one eutectic phase is formed during solidification, leading to uniform microstructure and improved mechanical properties. On the other hand, Hypereutectic alloys contain higher RE content, resulting in the formation of multiple eutectic phases and potentially enhancing specific properties such as hardness and wear resistance. Both types offer unique advantages for various applications in the alloy industry.</p></p>
