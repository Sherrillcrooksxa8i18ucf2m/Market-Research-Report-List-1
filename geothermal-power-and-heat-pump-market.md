<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power and Heat Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Loop System</li><li>Open Loop System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power and heat pumps utilize the earth's natural heat to provide energy for heating and cooling systems. Closed loop systems circulate a fluid, usually water or antifreeze, through a closed loop of underground pipes to transfer heat. Open loop systems draw water from a well or pond to extract heat before returning the water back to the source. Both systems are effective in harnessing geothermal energy, with closed loop systems being more common due to their versatility and efficiency.</p></p>
