<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyimide resins are a type of high-performance polymer that can be classified into two main market types: Thermoplastics and Thermosetting. Thermoplastics can be melted and reformed multiple times without undergoing any significant chemical change, making them suitable for applications requiring flexibility and durability. In contrast, Thermosetting polyimide resins undergo a permanent chemical change when heated and molded, resulting in a strong and rigid material that is resistant to heat and chemicals. Both types of polyimide resins are widely used in industries such as aerospace, electronics, and automotive for their excellent thermal and mechanical properties.</p></p>
