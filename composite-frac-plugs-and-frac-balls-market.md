<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Frac Plugs and Frac Balls Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Composite Plugs</li><li>Dissolvable Plugs</li><li>Cast Iron Plugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite frac plugs are devices used in hydraulic fracturing operations to isolate and control fluid flow within oil and gas wells. They are made of composite materials and can be easily drilled out after the fracturing process. Dissolvable plugs are similar but are made of materials that can dissolve over time, eliminating the need for drilling out. Cast iron plugs, on the other hand, are traditional, non-dissolvable plugs made of cast iron. Each type of plug has its own advantages and is used in different conditions depending on the requirements of the well.</p></p>
