<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LNG Loading & Offloading Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CBM (Conventional Buoy Mooring)</li><li>SPM (Single Point Mooring)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LNG Loading & Offloading Systems Market includes two main types: Conventional Buoy Mooring (CBM) and Single Point Mooring (SPM). CBM systems utilize multiple buoys to anchor the LNG carrier during loading and offloading, while SPM systems use a single buoy. CBM systems are commonly used in shallower waters and are less expensive to install, whereas SPM systems are preferred in deeper waters and can accommodate larger LNG carriers. Both systems play a crucial role in the efficient transfer of LNG between carriers and terminals.</p></p>
