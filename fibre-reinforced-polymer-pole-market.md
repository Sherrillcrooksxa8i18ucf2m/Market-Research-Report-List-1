<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fibre Reinforced Polymer Pole Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pultrusion</li><li>Filament Winding</li><li>Centrifugal Casting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) pole market consists of three main types of manufacturing processes: pultrusion, filament winding, and centrifugal casting. Pultrusion involves pulling continuous fibers through a resin bath and then through a heated die to create a solid FRP profile. Filament winding uses continuous fibers that are wound around a rotating mandrel to create a hollow structure. Centrifugal casting involves pouring resin and fibers into a rotating mold to form a cylindrical shape. Each method offers unique advantages and characteristics for FRP pole production.</p></p>
