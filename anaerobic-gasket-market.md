<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anaerobic Gasket Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anaerobic gaskets are divided into two main types: Type I and Type II. Type I anaerobic gaskets are designed for use in rigid assemblies with minimal flange deflection, providing a high-strength seal for joints under high pressure. On the other hand, Type II anaerobic gaskets are more flexible and elastic, making them suitable for applications where there may be flange movement or thermal cycling. Both types of anaerobic gaskets provide effective sealing solutions for different types of joints and assembly requirements.</p></p>
