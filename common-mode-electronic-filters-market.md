<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Common Mode Electronic Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-pass</li><li>Low-pass</li><li>Band-pass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Common mode electronic filters can be classified into three main types based on their frequency response: high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters. High-pass filters allow high-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating low-frequency signals. Low-pass filters, on the other hand, allow low-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating high-frequency signals. Band-pass filters only allow a specific range of frequencies to pass through, attenuating frequencies outside of this range. Each type of filter serves a specific purpose in eliminating common-mode noise from electronic circuits.</p></p>
