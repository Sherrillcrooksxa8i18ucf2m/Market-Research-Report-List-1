<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VRLA Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbed Glass Mat Battery</li><li>Gel Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>VRLA (Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid) batteries are commonly available in two main types â€“ Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) and Gel batteries. AGM batteries use a glass mat separator to hold the electrolyte solution in place, providing high performance and durability. Gel batteries, on the other hand, use silica to immobilize the electrolyte, making them maintenance-free and suitable for deep cycle applications. Both types of VRLA batteries offer reliable power supply, longer lifespan, and are leak-proof, making them popular choices for various applications.</p></p>
