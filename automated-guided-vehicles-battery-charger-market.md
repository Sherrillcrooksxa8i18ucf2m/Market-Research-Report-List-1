<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Guided Vehicles Battery Charger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Charger</li><li>Non Contact Charger</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) battery chargers can be divided into two types: Contact chargers and Non-contact chargers. Contact chargers require physical connection between the charger and the AGV for charging to occur, typically through a plug or charging station. Non-contact chargers, on the other hand, use methods such as inductive or magnetic charging to charge the AGV without direct physical contact. Both types of chargers have their own advantages and limitations, depending on factors such as efficiency, convenience, and cost.</p></p>
