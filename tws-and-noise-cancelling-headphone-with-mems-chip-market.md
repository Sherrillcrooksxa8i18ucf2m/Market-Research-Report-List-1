<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TWS and Noise-Cancelling Headphone with MEMS Chip Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Noise Reduction</li><li>Active Noise Cancellation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive Noise Reduction refers to headphones that block out external noise through physical barriers like ear cups and padding. Active Noise Cancellation headphones use technology, such as a MEMS chip, to analyze and counteract incoming noise. The MEMS chip detects ambient sounds and creates sound waves that cancel out the noise before it reaches the ear. Both types of headphones are popular in the market, with Active Noise Cancellation headphones generally offering superior noise-blocking capabilities compared to Passive Noise Reduction.</p></p>
