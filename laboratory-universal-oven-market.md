<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Universal Oven Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Convection</li><li>Forced Convection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A Laboratory Universal Oven can be categorized into two main types based on the method of heat distribution: Natural Convection and Forced Convection. </p><p>In a Natural Convection oven, heat is distributed purely by the natural movement of air inside the oven chamber, without the use of external fans. This type of oven is suitable for applications requiring gentle and uniform heating.</p><p>On the other hand, Forced Convection ovens utilize external fans to circulate air more efficiently and rapidly throughout the chamber, providing faster and more uniform heating for applications that require higher temperature precision and control.</p></p>
