<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military and Aerospace TVS Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uni-polar TVS</li><li>Bi-polar TVS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Military and Aerospace TVS diodes are often classified into two main types: uni-polar TVS and bi-polar TVS. Uni-polar TVS diodes are designed to handle high power transients by redirecting current to the ground during an overvoltage event. On the other hand, bi-polar TVS diodes are capable of handling both positive and negative voltage transients by providing bidirectional protection. The choice between uni-polar and bi-polar TVS diodes depends on the specific application requirements and the nature of potential transient events.</p></p>
