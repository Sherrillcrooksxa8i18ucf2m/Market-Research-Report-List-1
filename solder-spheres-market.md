<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solder Spheres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lead Solder Spheres</li><li>Lead Free Solder Spheres</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solder spheres are small balls of solder used in electronic packaging processes. There are two main types of solder spheres: lead solder spheres and lead-free solder spheres. Lead solder spheres contain lead, which is toxic and harmful to the environment. Lead-free solder spheres are made with alternative materials that are more environmentally friendly. The market for lead-free solder spheres is growing due to regulations restricting the use of lead in electronic products, while lead solder spheres are still used in some applications where lead-free alternatives are not feasible.</p></p>
